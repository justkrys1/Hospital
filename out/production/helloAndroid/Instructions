Using your existing application, add an additional activity with appropriate menus
    that will show a Google Map with the closest Hospital and Urgent Care locations to
    the user.  Make sure these locations are marked with pins so the user can find
    directions easily.

Use a tutorial such as this to help you.
This assignment will not be lectured so it is an example of figuring it out by yourself.
